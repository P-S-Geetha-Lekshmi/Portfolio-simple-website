INTRODUCTION:

This is a basic personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS, aimed at providing a simple and clean online presence. The website consists of two main sections:

HOME PAGE:

Introduces who I am, with a brief description and purpose of the site. It serves as a landing page to give visitors a quick overview.

CONTACT PAGE:

Contains basic contact details so visitors can reach out easily.

The design is minimal and responsive, making it suitable for personal use, especially for beginners who want to learn how to structure and style a static website. This project can serve as a foundation for adding more features such as a Projects page, About Me section, or integrating JavaScript for interactivity.

FEATURES:

1)Built with semantic HTML and basic CSS

2)Mobile-friendly layout

3)Easy to customize and expand
